      All information collected will only be stored on your device and will not
      be shared with others or third-party services. It is used to remember the
      options that you have chosen before, and for nothing else. In this way,
      you can close your application or even unistall it, and you'll always have
      your settings. In order to provide you an excellent offline experience,
      the first time you use it, the necessary resources will be loaded into
      cache. This is a Progressive Web Application (PWA), which operates via
      your browser, so you only need to restore your usual browser data.

      Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as
      anonymous unique identifiers and are stored only in your device's internal

      your experience and you may have not access to some parts of the app if
      you refuse to accept them.
